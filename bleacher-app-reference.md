## Live Status Tracking System

**Status Flow:**
1. **Scheduled** (default - gray) - Job is assigned to schedule
2. **En Route** (blue) - Tech is traveling to job site
3. **Checked In** (blue) - Tech arrives on-site, timestamp auto-captured
4. **Complete** (green) - Job successfully finished, timestamp auto-captured
5. **Unable to Complete** (red) - Job couldn't be completed, auto-moves to Shit List

**Field Tech Actions (My Jobs):**
- "Check In" button when Scheduled/En Route
- "Mark Complete" + "Unable to Complete" buttons when Checked In
- Unable to Complete opens modal requiring:
  - Reason (Wrong Part, Can't Access, Additional Work, Equipment Issue, Other)
  - Notes (optional)
  - Photo (optional)
  - Auto-moves job to Shit List and marks as pink

**Office/Admin Views:**
- **Jobs view:** Real-time status board with progress stats (X/Y completed, In Progress, En Route)
- **Scheduling view:** Status column in spreadsheet with color-coded badges
- Can see all status updates as field techs make changes
- Completed jobs fade to 70% opacity for visual distinction

**Data Persistence:**
- All status updates save to localStorage
- Timestamps stored in ISO format
- Updates sync across all views (My Jobs, Jobs, Scheduling, Team Schedule)

**Technical Implementation:**
- Status data stored in `scheduleDataOriginal` and `scheduleDataSouthern` objects (js/views/scheduling.js)
- Each job has optional properties: `status`, `checkedInAt`, `completedAt`, `unableToCompleteAt`, `unableToCompleteReason`, `unableToCompleteNotes`, `unableToCompletePhoto`
- Status update functions in js/views/my-jobs.js:
  - `checkInJob(jobId)` - Sets status to 'checked_in' + timestamp
  - `completeJob(jobId)` - Sets status to 'complete' + timestamp
  - `unableToCompleteJob(jobId)` - Opens modal, then calls `submitUnableToComplete()`
  - `updateJobStatus(jobId, newStatus, additionalFields)` - Updates across both territories
  - `moveJobToShitList(jobId, reason, notes)` - Creates shit list entry + marks as pink
- Real-time sync: Status changes trigger re-renders in all active views
- Week progress calculated by filtering jobs for current tech and counting completed vs total

## v3.0 Development Plan (In Progress)

**Branch:** `v3-feedback-implementation`
**Timeline:** 3-4 weeks (Feb 6 - Mar 7, 2026)
**Goal:** Address team feedback from Story (Director of Operations) and Atiba prototype review

### Key Changes: Sales vs Operations Separation

**Problem Identified:**
Current "Pipeline" view mixes pre-sale (estimates, follow-ups) with post-sale (operational execution). This creates confusion between sales tracking and project management.

**Solution:**
Split into two distinct views:
1. **Sales Pipeline** - Pre-sale: estimates, client follow-ups, deal grading (A/B/C)
2. **Project Tracker** - Post-sale: operational execution, scheduling, completion tracking

### Implementation Phases

#### **PHASE 1: Pipeline Restructure (Week 1)**

**Rename & Relocate Current Pipeline:**
1. ✅ Rename "Pipeline" view → "Project Tracker"
2. ✅ Move from Sales nav section → Logistics nav section
3. ✅ Add date fields (date received, date started, target date, completed date)
4. ✅ Add sort by oldest→newest
5. ✅ Add Labor Amount and Total Project Value to project cards

**Create New Sales Pipeline:**
6. ✅ New "Sales Pipeline" view in Sales section
7. ✅ Sales-specific stages (matching Salesmate workflow):
   - Estimate in Process
   - Operations Review
   - Estimate Complete (Ready to be Sent)
   - Client Review/Follow Up
   - In Process/PO Received
   - Complete
8. ✅ Add A/B/C deal grading system (replaces probability %)
9. ✅ Add estimate delivery status indicators
10. ✅ Add follow-up tracking features

#### **PHASE 2: Quick Win Features (Week 2-3)**

**Work Orders & Scheduling:**
11. ✅ Add "Special Instructions" field to work orders (prominent at top)
12. ✅ Add "Confirmed/Unconfirmed" checkbox to schedule entries
13. ✅ Add "Equipment Rental Required" tag to schedule

**Estimates Enhancement:**
14. ✅ Add Shipping line item to estimate form
15. ✅ Add Labor line item to estimate form

**Internal Tools:**
16. ✅ Add Internal Notes field (not visible to customers)

**Note:** Pink List/Go Backs tab already exists in Scheduling → Shit List (not duplicating)

#### **PHASE 3: Testing & Polish (Week 4)**
17. Field beta testing with 2-3 techs
18. QuickBooks integration testing
19. Bug fixes and refinements

### Total Features: 17 items
- Pipeline restructure: 10 items
- Quick wins: 6 items
- Testing phase: 1 item

### Estimated Effort: ~20 hours development time

## Atiba Comparison & Decision

**Date:** February 6, 2026
**Status:** Decided to continue DIY approach instead of waiting for Atiba

**Atiba's Issues (from Story's feedback):**
- ❌ Tech view only showed "today's jobs" (not weekly schedule)
- ❌ "Extremely limited" inspection module
- ❌ Office Manager couldn't see work orders
- ❌ Manual time tracking required
- ❌ Dashboard guessing at metrics with unnecessary clutter

**Our Strengths:**
- ✅ Tech weekly schedule (Mon-Fri grid for all roles)
- ✅ Multi-bank inspection with issue tracking
- ✅ Jobs operational view for Office/Admin
- ✅ Automated timestamp capture
- ✅ Clean, purposeful interface

**Comparison Score:** 72% of team requirements already built or partially built
- 18 items fully built (38%)
- 16 items partially built (34%)
- 13 items not yet built (28%)

**Decision:** Continue DIY. We're further along than Atiba after their months of design work.

See `atiba-feedback-comparison.md` for detailed breakdown.

## Troubleshooting

**Buttons/Navigation Not Working:**
1. Open browser console (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
2. Look for red errors - syntax errors will prevent subsequent JS files from loading
3. Check script load order in index.html (config → data → views → utils → app)
4. Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+F5) to clear cache

**Functions Showing as "undefined":**
1. Check if earlier JS file has syntax error (will block subsequent files)
2. Verify function is defined in the correct file (use grep: `grep -n "function functionName" js/**/*.js`)
3. Check if file is loaded in index.html before it's called

**Status Updates Not Persisting:**
1. Check localStorage in browser DevTools → Application → Local Storage
2. Look for keys: `scheduleDataOriginal`, `scheduleDataSouthern`
3. Clear localStorage if corrupted: `localStorage.clear()` in console

**Week Navigation Not Working:**
1. Verify week offset calculation in relevant view file (my-jobs.js, scheduling.js)
2. Check `getWeekStart()` function in scheduling.js
3. Sample data is hardcoded for Feb 3-7, 2025 - offset auto-calculated from current date

## Critical Principles

- **"If it didn't happen in QuickBooks, it didn't happen at all"**
- **Inspector after-hours work is the #1 pain point**
- **Schools have poor WiFi** - offline mode critical
- **Multi-vendor jobs are common** - search all vendors
- **DIY approach is working** - keep building

---

## Complexity Notes

**Current Scope:** The app has grown significantly with multiple interconnected systems:
- **3 role-based dashboards** (Admin, Office, Field) with different navigation
- **8 major view modules** across 9 JS files (inspection, scheduling, my-jobs, dashboard, ops-review, create, admin, office, field)
- **Real-time state management** across multiple views (jobs data syncs across My Jobs, Jobs, Scheduling, Team Schedule)
- **Multi-territory support** (Original/Southern) with separate data stores
- **Status tracking system** with 5 states, action buttons, modal workflows, and automatic shit list creation
- **Week-based scheduling** with dynamic date calculations and progress tracking

**Architectural Decisions:**
- Plain HTML/CSS/JS (no framework) - keeps it simple but requires manual state sync
- localStorage for persistence - works offline but limited to ~5-10MB
- Sample data hardcoded in scheduling.js - good for demo, will need backend for production
- Modular JS files - good separation but requires careful load order (see bug fix v2.1.1)
- Section comments in large files - improves navigation as files grow (v2.1.2)

**Future Considerations:**
- Consider React/Vue if complexity continues to grow (state management, component reusability)
- Backend API for job data (currently only Airtable for parts)
- Real-time updates (WebSockets/Firebase) for multi-user scenarios
- Mobile-first redesign (current responsive but desktop-optimized)
